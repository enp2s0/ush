# uSH: a small shell
## Written by Noah Brecht

A micro-shell for the Linux. It supports piping a redirection and has a few builtins. It is considerably smaller that bash, zsh, etc.
It also has no dependencies, making it extremely portable.

The build process is extremely simple:
`make all` to build.
`./ush` to run.
`make clean` to clean the source tree and remove binaries/objects.
